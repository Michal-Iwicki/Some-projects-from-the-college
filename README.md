# Machine Learning & Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains selected projects to which I made significant contributions, as well as projects I developed independently.  
They are grouped into four thematic categories.

## 1. Classical Machine Learning & Classification

Projects focused on classical machine learning using widely adopted frameworks:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering with **pandas**
- Model development using **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**
- Model evaluation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Text clustering using dimensionality reduction techniques for NLP tasks

## 2. Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented from Scratch

Projects exploring the theoretical foundations of machine learning through custom implementations:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks
- Dimensionality reduction methods and matrix approximation techniques

These implementations were designed to deepen my understanding of optimization methods, linear algebra, and statistical learning theory.

## 3. Data Engineering & Distributed Systems

Projects focused on building scalable data processing systems in both cloud and distributed environments:

- Infrastructure provisioning and deployment using **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- Implementation of a distributed data pipeline based on the **Apache ecosystem**  
  (**NiFi, Kafka, Spark, HDFS, Cassandra**)
- Designed a **Lambda Architecture** combining streaming classification with batch processing
- Built end-to-end data workflows integrating data ingestion, processing, storage, and model inference

## 4. Deep Learning & Large Language Models

Projects involving modern deep learning approaches:

- Image and audio classification using **PyTorch**
- Use of open-source models from **Hugging Face**
- Running and evaluating local LLMs
- Safety evaluation experiments
- Prompt rephrasing systems
- Application of the “LLM-as-a-judge” evaluation approach
